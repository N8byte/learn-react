# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I had a lot of fun going through the introductory React course. It seems like a great way to make
dynamic webpages with lots of intuitive features to render HTML elements with JavaScript.
